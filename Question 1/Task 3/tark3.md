## When creating or consuming an API, the following key considerations ensure security and reliability:

1. `Authentication & Authorization:` Use robust methods like OAuth2 or JWT to verify users and their permissions.
2. `Validation & Sanitization:` Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection).
3. `Rate Limiting:` Implement throttling to prevent abuse or DDoS attacks.
4. `Error Handling:` Provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive details.
5. `Encryption:` Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
6. `Monitoring & Logging:` Log API requests and monitor for unusual activity.
7. `Versioning:` Maintain versioned endpoints to ensure backward compatibility.
